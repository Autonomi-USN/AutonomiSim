# AutonomiSim
This repository is the home to the source code for the USN SeaDrone simulation implementation, based off the VRX/WAM-V simulation repository (https://github.com/osrf/vrx)

- Provides a platform for the development and testing of the usn SeaDrone. 
- Fork of the original osrf/vrx gazebo
- Made to aid development of the real SeaDrone Robot
- Hydrodynamics, localization, navigation  
<br />

## Startup

To start the simulation, run the ```usn_drone_gazebo/launch/usn_drone.launch``` launch file: \
```roslaunch usn_drone_gazebo main_setup.launch``` \
This launch file initializes the example_world gazebo map, and spawns the robot. \
The file also launches the localization node, and the cmd_vel, which simplifies the development of autonomous navigation. 
</br></br>

### Navigation

The repository implements a PD+LOS algorithm for navigation, as a ROS action server. \
```rosrun usn_navigation server_pd_los.py``` \
The action server takes a 2DPoseArray, consisting of n poses. \
When the server receives a goal, it iterates through the list of positions (x, y) and publishes on the 'cmd_vel' topic, navigating towards the next position.

```rosrun usn_navigation visualize_path_taken.py``` will subscribe to the localization of the robot and publish a Path message which may be viewed in RviZ.
