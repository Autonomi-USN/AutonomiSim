# AutonomiSim
This repository is the home to the source code for the USN SeaDrone simulation implementation, based off the VRX/WAM-V simulation repository (https://github.com/osrf/vrx)
* Provides a platform for development and testing of the usn SeaDrone. 



## Startup

To begin the simulation, run the ```usn_drone_gazebo/launch/usn_drone.launch``` launch file:
```roslaunch usn_drone_gazebo usn_drone.launch```
